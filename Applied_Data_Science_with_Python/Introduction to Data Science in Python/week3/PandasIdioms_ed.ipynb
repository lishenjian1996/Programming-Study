    "Python programmers will often suggest that there many ways the language can be used to solve a particular problem. But that some are more appropriate than others. The best solutions are celebrated as Idiomatic Python and there are lots of great examples of this on StackOverflow and other websites.\n",

    "A sort of sub-language within Python, Pandas has its own set of idioms. We've alluded to some of these already, such as using vectorization whenever possible, and not using iterative loops if you don't need to. Several developers and users within the Panda's community have used the term __pandorable__ for these idioms. I  think it's a great term. So, I wanted to share with you a couple of key features of how you can make your code  pandorable."
