    "A pivot table is a way of summarizing data in a DataFrame for a particular purpose. It makes heavy use of the aggregation function. A pivot table is itself a DataFrame, where the rows represent one variable that you're interested in, the columns another, and the cell's some aggregate value. A pivot table also tends to includes marginal values as well, which are the sums for each column and row. This allows you to be able to see the relationship between two variables at just a glance."

And of course, you can pass any function you want to the aggregate function, including those that you define yourself."
