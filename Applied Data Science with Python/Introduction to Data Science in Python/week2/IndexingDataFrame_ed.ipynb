    "# Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen, both Series and DataFrames can have indices applied to them. The index is essentially a row level label, and in pandas the rows correspond to axis zero. Indices can either be either autogenerated, such as when  we create a new Series without an index, in which case we get numeric values, or they can be set explicitly, like when we use the dictionary object to create the series, or when we loaded data from the CSV file and set appropriate parameters. Another option for setting an index is to use the set_index() function. This function takes a list of columns and promotes those columns to an index. In this lecture we'll explore more about how indexes work in pandas."

    "Okay so that's how hierarchical indices work in a nutshell. They're a special part of the pandas library which I think can make management and reasoning about data easier. Of course hierarchical labeling isn't just for rows. For example, you can transpose this matrix and now have hierarchical column labels. And projecting a single column which has these labels works exactly the way you would expect it to. Now, in reality, I don't tend to use hierarchical indicies very much, and instead just keep everything as columns and manipulate those. But, it's a unique and sophisticated aspect of pandas that is useful to know, especially if viewing your data in a tabular form."
