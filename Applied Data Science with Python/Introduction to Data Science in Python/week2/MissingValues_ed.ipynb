    "# Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen a preview of how Pandas handles missing values using the None type and NumPy NaN values. Missing values are pretty common in data cleaning activities. And, missing values can be there for any number of reasons, and I just want to touch on a few here.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if you are running a survey and a respondant didn't answer a question the missing value is actually an omission. This kind of missing data is called **Missing at Random** if there are other variables that might be used to predict the variable which is missing. In my work when I delivery surveys I often find that missing data, say the interest in being involved in a follow up study, often has some correlation with another data field, like gender or ethnicity. If there is no relationship to other variables, then we call this data **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just two examples of missing data, and there are many more. For instance, data might be missing because it wasn't collected, either by the process responsible for collecting that data, such as a researcher, or because it wouldn't make sense if it were collected. This last example is extremely common when you start joining DataFrames together from multiple sources, such as joining a list of people at a university with a list of offices in the university (students generally don't have offices).\n",

    "One last note on missing values. When you use statistical functions on DataFrames, these functions typically ignore missing values. For instance if you try and calculate the mean value of a DataFrame, the underlying NumPy function will ignore missing values. This is usually what you want but you should be aware that values are being excluded. Why you have missing values really matters depending upon the problem you are trying to solve. It might be unreasonable to infer missing values, for instance, if the data shouldn't exist in the first place."
